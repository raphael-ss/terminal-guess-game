# terminal-guess-game
Contains all the files and changes to a python terminal guess game

This is a guessing game. By default, we have 6 lockers. 
    Choose the right one to win the game. 
    Everytime you play, the winning locker will change.
    Just type in your guess and let the
    destiny (or the computer) tell you!
